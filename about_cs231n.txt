Since the early assignments are managed entirely through pip,
and conda has no real visibility into pip-installed dependencies,
you must use pip to install pylint & black.

ALSO, latest pylint relies on an incompatible version of astroid,
so we CAN'T use the legacy-resolver. so, do:

ALSO, since jupyter notebooks aren't ipython kernel aware
(hoorah for vs-code), we must install ipykernel:

	cd .../cs231n
	conda remove --name cs231n --all
	conda env create --file .\cs231n.yaml
	conda activate cs231n

	# # fixed: included pip commands in the conda yaml.
	# cd assignment1
	# pip install -r requirements.txt
	# pip install ipykernel pylint black flake8
	
	cd assignmentX
	code .

For updates:
	conda deactivate
	conda env update --file .\cs231n.yaml  # prune is useless since everything is through pip
	conda activate cs231n
